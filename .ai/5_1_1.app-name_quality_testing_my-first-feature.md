**Happy Path**

```text 
 {Create a test spec file at `./tests/1_my-first-feature.spec.ts`
- Add a playwright boilerplate using the Gherkin syntax:
  - Given I am on the <right place>
  - When I do something <good>
  - Then I see the <expected result>
- Implement the test scenarios for current source code
- Commit the changes using Conventional Commits.
 }
```

**Edge Cases**
