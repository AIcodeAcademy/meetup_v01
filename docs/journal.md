# Development Journal

## 2024-03-XX - Initial Implementation

### Key Actions
1. Set up project structure with TypeScript and Vite
2. Implemented compound interest calculator form
3. Added value objects for validation
4. Set up e2e tests with Playwright

### Technical Decisions
1. Used Value Objects instead of validation libraries
2. Implemented form as Web Component for encapsulation
3. Used PicoCSS for minimal styling
4. Stored calculations in localStorage for persistence

### Lessons Learned
1. Value Objects provide good validation without external deps
2. Web Components offer good encapsulation for forms
3. PicoCSS provides good defaults while being lightweight

## Project Timeline

### January 30, 2024

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Vite + TypeScript project structure
   - Added PicoCSS for styling
   - Configured Playwright for E2E testing

2. **Feature: Compound Interest Calculator**
   - Implemented basic form component
   - Added input validation
   - Set up calculation logic
   - Added responsive styling

## Key Decisions

1. **Technology Choices**
   - Selected Vite for fast development and optimal production builds
   - Chose PicoCSS for minimal footprint and semantic styling
   - Used TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Component-based structure for maintainability
   - Value objects for data validation
   - Event-driven user interactions

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Focus on user flows and edge cases

## Lessons Learned

1. **Development Process**
   - Value objects provide better type safety than primitive types
   - PicoCSS reduces need for custom styling while maintaining good UX
   - Component-based architecture simplifies maintenance

2. **Testing Insights**
   - E2E tests catch integration issues early
   - Playwright provides good developer experience for testing

## Future Improvements

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Add unit tests for calculation logic
   - Improve error handling
   - Add more accessibility features

2. **Feature Ideas**
   - Add chart visualization
   - Support different compounding frequencies
   - Add result export functionality
