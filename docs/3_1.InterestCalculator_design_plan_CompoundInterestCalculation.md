# 3.1 InterestCalculator - Design - Compound Interest Calculation

> `3_1.InterestCalculator_design_plan_CompoundInterestCalculation.md`

This document outlines the design for the `CompoundInterestCalculation` feature of the **InterestCalculator** application. It details the input parameters, output, and processing logic for calculating compound interest and generating a year-by-year growth table.

## 1. Feature Overview

The `CompoundInterestCalculation` feature is a core component of the InterestCalculator. It allows users to calculate compound interest based on several input parameters and visualize the investment growth over time in a tabular format.

## 2. Input Parameters

The feature requires the following input parameters from the user:

- **Principal Amount**: The initial amount of money invested.
  - Data Type: Number (positive decimal)
  - Input Method: Text field with currency formatting.
- **Annual Interest Rate**: The yearly interest rate in percentage.
  - Data Type: Number (positive decimal)
  - Input Method: Text field with percentage formatting.
- **Compounding Frequency**: How often the interest is compounded.
  - Data Type: String (enum: "Daily", "Monthly", "Quarterly", "Annually")
  - Input Method: Dropdown select.
- **Time Period**: The duration of the investment in years.
  - Data Type: Integer (positive)
  - Input Method: Text field with number input.

## 3. Output

The feature will generate a year-by-year growth table displaying the following columns:

- **Year**: The year number, starting from 1.
  - Data Type: Integer
- **Starting Principal**: The principal amount at the beginning of the year.
  - Data Type: Number (decimal, currency formatted)
- **Interest Earned**: The interest earned during the year.
  - Data Type: Number (decimal, currency formatted)
- **Ending Principal**: The principal amount at the end of the year, including the interest earned.
  - Data Type: Number (decimal, currency formatted)

## 4. Processing Logic

The compound interest calculation will be performed using the following formula:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
- P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
- r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
- n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
  - Daily: 365
  - Monthly: 12
  - Quarterly: 4
  - Annually: 1
- t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

The year-by-year table will be generated iteratively:

1. Initialize the first year's starting principal with the input Principal Amount.
2. For each year up to the Time Period:
    - Calculate the interest earned for the year based on the Compounding Frequency and Annual Interest Rate.
    - Calculate the ending principal by adding the interest earned to the starting principal.
    - For the next year, set the starting principal to the current year's ending principal.
3. Populate the table with Year, Starting Principal, Interest Earned, and Ending Principal for each year.

## 5. UI Considerations

- Input fields should be clearly labeled and user-friendly.
- Appropriate input masks and validation should be applied to ensure correct data types and formats.
- The generated table should be clearly displayed and easily understandable.

## 6. Future Considerations

- Implement export functionality for the table (e.g., CSV download).
- Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative principal amount).
- Consider adding options for different compounding periods (e.g., bi-annually, continuously).
